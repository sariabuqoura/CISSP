# CISSP
## Domain 1 
### 1.1 Code of Ethics 
* ISC^2 code of ethics 
  * Preamble 
  * Canons (4)
  * Complaints/ Violation 
* Organization Code of Ethics 
* Ethics & the internet RFC 1087 [IAB]
* Ten Commandment of computer ethics
* Code of fair information practices (5)
* Cybersecurity credentials collaborative C3
  * Integrity, objectivity, profissional, confidentiality.
### 1.2 CIA
* Confidentiality
  * &
  * Concealment 
  * Seclusion: storing in an out of the way location.
  * Isolation: Seperate from others.   
* Integrity
  * &
  * Oversight: an unintentional failure to notice or do something
  * Ineptitude: lack of skill or ability
* Availability
  * Depend on both of integrity & Encryption  
* Other security concepets 
  * Overprotection
    *   Overprotecting integrity can result in a restriction of availability.
    *   Over providing availability can result in loss of confidentiality and integrity.  
  * Authenticity: originates from its alleged source (the recipient can have a high level of confidance that the data is from whom it claims it be from)
  * Nonrepudiation: Digital Certificates, Session identifiers, transaction logs
  * AAA Service abbreviation refer to Authentication, Authorization, Accounting but it actually means the five elements: 
    * Identification: claming the be an identity.
    * Authentication: prove the identity (Identification and Authentication are single two steps process ) [passwords are the least secure].
    * Authorization: permission
    * Auditing: recording logs 
    * Accounting: review logs to check for compliance and violations
* Protection Mechanisms 
  * Defense in Depth:
    * a single failed control should not result in exposure of the system or data 
    * Serial configuration (oppsite that applicaiton new ideas)  
      * If parallel a threat could pass through a single checkpoint that did not address its particular malcious activity 
      * serial is very narrow but very deep, parallel is very wide but very shallow   
  * Abstraction: is used for efficiency, Similar elements are put into groups,classes, roles.(abstraction simplifes security).
    * thats is how to send input and receive output.

  * Data Hiding: subject cant see or access the data (not accesible)
    * Preventing application access hardware directly 
    * Insure that data existing at one level of security is not visble to process running at diffrent security level.
    * Data hiding is the act of intentionally positioning data so that it is not viewable or accessible to an unauthorized subject.   
  * Security through obscurity: hoping that no one will discover the issue and exploit it.
  * Encryption : :D

* Security Boundaries: is the line of intersection between two areas, high security and a low security one.
  * the distinction between classification is a security boundary.
  * in most casses interface is clearly marked, and unauthorized subject are informed that attempts to gain access will result in prosecution.
  * Logical: the points where electronic comminications a interface with device or service compay is legally responsible. ??xx?? 
  * Phycial: warning signs are posted .
  * security mechanisim must be reasonable, cost-effective and effcient (must be weighted agnist the value of the objects)
### 1.3 Evaludate and apply security Governance Principles 
 Preformed by Bard of director or CEO or CISO
 Security governance seeks to compare the security processes and infrastructure used within the orgnization
 security governance seeks to compare the security orocesses and infrastructure used within the organization with the knowledge and insight from external source 
* Thrid-Party Governance: External Auditer (full and open document exchange).
* Document Review : 
  * Reading the exchanged materials and verifying them aginst standards and expectations 
  * if exchanged documents sufficient and meets the expectations or at least the requirements, then onsite review will be focised on compiance 
  * if exchanged documents is incomplete, inacurate or insufficient, the on site review is postponded until document is ready.
  * can result of voiding authorization to operate ATO
  * complete document can provide temporary ATO TATO.
* Manage The Security Function
  *  operating a business that focuses on the tasks of evaluating and improving security over time.
  *  preforming risks assessment to drive the security policy is the clearest and most direct example if managment of security function 
  *  Security must be measureabl.
  *  tracking and assessing security metrics is part of effective security.
* Alignment if Security Function to Business Strategy Goals, Mission, and Objectives 
   * security management planning ensure proper creation, implementation, enforcment.
   * middel management to flesh out the security policy into standred, baseline procedures 
   * the operational managers / security professionals must implement the configuration in the policy 
   * top down approcah , not bottom-uo approch
   * InfoSec team should be led by designated CISO report to (Senior Managment,CIO,CEO,or board of directors)
   * CISO, CISO's teams outside the hierarchical structure.
   * CIO ensure information is used effectivly to accomplish bussiness objective.
   * CTO ensure that equipment and software work properly to support the bussiness function.
   * You May Found under CISCO 
     * CSO:Chief Security officer : Physical security. 
     * ISO: Infomration security Officer  
* policy development team to educate senior managment .
* security managment planning team shoud develop 3 plans :
  * Stratigic Plan 
  * Tactial Plan 
  * Operational Plan  
* Organizational Processes
  * Aquisitions,Divestitures
  * Minimizing inherent threats.
  * products that have resilient security are more expensive.
  * when considering the cost of merger.acuisition importanat to consider total cost of ownership
  * external org is unable to manger their business in secure basis how they can provide reliable security to you ? 
  * evaluation 3rd party integration 
    * On site assessment
    * Document Exchange and Review
    * Process/Policy Review
    * Third Party Audit (American Institue of certified public Accountants AICPA) Unbaiased review of security, and (SOC reports (Service Organization Control))
  * New Service/Hardware should meet or exceed your current security posture  
  * Review SLA
  * When Service is being crafted SLR must be defined, SLR statment of expectation of service/ preforamce 
  * SLR is provided by customer/ client prior to the establishment of SLA
  * Two  Additional examples 
    * strong security goveranace (change control/ change managment )
    * data classification
* Organizational Roles and Responsibilites 
* Senior Manager: 
  * Responsbile for the security 
  * must sign off on all security policy 
  * is liable for success or failure 
* Security Professional: 
  * Other Names:
    * Security Professional
    * InfoSec Officer 
    * CIRET (Computer incident response team) 
  * functional responsbility for security.
  * writing security policy and implementing it 
  * it maybe Operation but focus on protection more than function 
  * this role is often filled by team responsbile for designing and implementing security solutions.
  * security profissional and not decision makers 
* Asset Owner 
  * assgined to the person who classify information for placment onf protection ??xx??
  * responsbile for asset protection 
  * actual data managment tasks deligated to a custodian
* Custodian
  * responsbile for the tasks of implementing the protection 
    * Testing Backup
    * Validate data integrity 
    * Deploying security solution 
    * manage data storage
* User 
  * any person who access the secured system to work on tasks (least privilege)   
* Audtior 
  * reviewing and verifying that security policy is properly implemented 

### Security Control Frameworks 
* CBOIT (mapping of IT Security ideals to business objectives)
  * provide stakeholder value 
  * holistic approch 
  * dynamic gvernance 
  * governance distinct 
  * tailored to enterprise needs 
  * end- to end governance
* NIST 800-53 Rev.5 (general recommendation for orgnaizational security)
* CIS  (Provide Hardwawre, security configuration guides)
* NISK RMF (Establishes Mandatory requirments for deferal agencies)
  * Categorize, Select, Implement, Assess, Authorize, Monitor
* NIST Cyber Security (CSF)(on an ongoing basis for the support and imporovment of security over time )
  * Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
* ISO (basis of implementing organization security and realted management)  
  * Plan, Do, Check Act
* ITIL (IT to Support bussiness growth)
* &
  * PCI DSS (Payment card Industry Data Security Standard)
  * OCTAVE self directed Risk Managment (Operationally Critical Threat, Assets, Vulneabilitiy Evaluation)
  * COSO (Commitee of sponsoring Organization) (Goals of the entire Organization) 
  * FARP (Faciliated Risk Anaylsis) (roundabletable brianstorm internal)
### Due care/due diligence
* Due care
  * Is doing the right action at the right time 
  * Is Practicing the indiviual activites.
* Due diligence
  * Is establishing a plan, policy, and process to protect the interests of the organization.
  * often involves gathering information through discovery, risk assessments and review of existing documentation; developing a formalized security structure
  * Is Knowing what should be done and planning for it 
* Showing both is the only way to diprove negligence.
### Security Policy, Standards, Procedures, And Guidenlines 
Developing and implementing documented security policy, standard, procedures, and guideline produces a solid and reliable security infrastructure
Once the security policy documentation is reasonably complet, it can be used to guide decisions
* Policy
  * Mandatory
  * Define the scope of security needed by the organization. 
  * Dicusess the assets that require protection. 
  * extend which securitu solition should go to provide the protection. 
  * Define strategic security objective,Vision, and goals.
  * Outline security framework.
  * indicate compliance requirments. 
  * define acceptable risk level. 
  * "This document is often used as the prrof that senior managemenet has exercised due diligence".
  * "Acceptable user Policy: define a level of acceptable perforamnce and expectiaon of behavior and activity".
  * fewer document because they contain in general broad discussions of overview and goals. 
* Standards
  * Mandatory 
  * define compulsory requirements for the homogenous use of hardware, software, technology, and security controls. 
* Baseline
  * Mandatory
  * Define Minimum level of security that every system throughout 
  * base line more operationally 
  * all systems not complying with the baseline should be taken out of production
* Guidelines
  * Not Mandatory
  * Offer recommendation on how standards and baseline are implemented
  * Guidelines are flexbile 
* Procedures
  * Mandatory
  * Is Detailed,setp by step how-to document.
  * Purpose of procedure is to ensure the integrity of business process 
  * Contanis details rather than policy for the below :
    * Not all users need to know the security standards,baseline,guidelines, and procedure
    * it is easier to update   
### Threat Modeling
 * is a process where potential threats are identified, categorized, and analyzed.
 * proactive measure during the design or development
 * reactive once a product has been deployed 
 * checks :
   * identifes the potential harm
   * probability of accurence
   * priority of concerns 
   * means to readicate or reduce the threat. 
 * microsoft moto : Secure by desgin, secure by default, secure in development 
   * has goals of 
     * to reduce the number of security related desgin and coding defects 
     * to reduce to severity of any remaning defects 
* Defensive approach
  * during the initial desgin, based on prediciting threat and designing in specific defense during the coding and crafting process 
  * Integrated security solutions are more cost effective and more successfull than those shoehorned in later {proactive approach to threat management}
  * Not all threats can be predicted during the desgin phase so reactive approach to threat managment is still needed.(threat hunting or adversarial approach).
  * (threat hunting or adversarial approach), after deployment could be in test or lab or general marketplace
    * Core concept behind echical hacking, pentesting, source code review, and fuzzing.
    * result in addtional effort in coding to add new countermeasure released as patching.
      * this result in less effective security improvements.
* Identifying threats:
  * The ultimate goal is to prioritize the potential threats.
  * Structured approach 
    * Focused on assets: assets evaluation, and threats to the valuble assets.
    * Focused on attackers : attacker motiviation goals, or Tactics techniques and procedures (TTPs)
    * Focused on softwares: Company create softwares  
  * Microsoft approach (STRIDE)
    * Spoofing : bypass filters 
    * Tampering : change data 
    * Repudiation : deny action
    * Information disclosure : distribution of private confidential to external or unauthorized entities 
    * Denial of service : prevent authorized use of a resource 
    * Elevation of privilege : change to account with greater privilege
  * Process for attack simulation and threat analysis PASTA
    * Risk- centric 
    * aims to select or develop countermeasures in relation to the value of the assets to be protected.
    * steps 
      * Stage I: Definition of the Objectives (DO) for the Analysis of Risk.
      * Stage II: Definition of the Technical Scope (DTS)
      * Stage III: Application Decomposition and Analysis (ADA)
      * Stage IV: Threat Analysis (TA)
      * Stage V: Weakness and Vulnerability Analysis (WVA)
      * Stage VI: Attack Modeling and Simulation (AMS)
      * Stage VII: Risk Analysis and Management (RAM)
    *  Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat (VAST) is a threat modeling concept that integrates threat and risk management into an Agile programming environment on a scalable basis
    *  consider threat level from indivduals including employees adversaries and treust pratners.
    *  Compny faces threats from nature, technology, people, always consider the best and worst possbile outcomes.
* Determining and Digramming Potential attacks
  * creating digram of the element involved in transaction along with indication of data flow and privilege.
* Preforming Reduction anaylsis 
  * Decomposing the application 
  * purpose is to gain a greater understandign of the logic of the product, its internal components, as well as its interncation with external elements.
    * Trust boundries: level of trust 
    * Dataflow Paths: the data movement 
    * Input points : location where external inout is received 
    * Privileged Operations : any activity require greater privilegs 
    * Details about security stance and approach : the declaration of security policy,foundation, assumptions 
    * once the threats are identified should be fully documeneted by target, consequences of a threat.
* Prioritization and Response 
  * Ranking & Rating 
  * Probility * Damage Potential Ranking 
  * High/Medium/Low 
  * DREAD System
    * Answer five questions  
      * Damage potential: how server is the damage 
      * Reproducibilility: how complicated to reproduce the exploit 
      * Exploitability : how hard to preform the attack
      * Affected Users : how many users are likley to be effected 
      * Discoverability : how hard for attacker to find it out 
    * Responses are needed for there threats 
    * remidate threats should be considered and weighted according to their cost and effectivness
    * threat modeling is similar to the risk assessment 
      * Threat modeling focus on the attack it self
      * Risk assessment focus on the asset. 
### Supply chain risk Managemen
* Hardware, devices, network, cloud services are not built by a single entity 
* vendor are perform the final assembly 
* any finished system has a long and complex history known as its called supply chain.
* SCRM is the means to ensure that all of the vendors or link in the supllu chain are reliable .
* each link in the chain should be responsbile and accountable to the next link 
* Goals 
  * ensure that the finished product is of sufficient qulity
  * no point in the process was any elemnt counterfeteited or subject to unauthorized or malicious mainuplation or sabotage 
* another threat vector 
* Just-in-time supply chain 
* is there surplus or Buffer of materials 
* attack on supply chain could result in flawed or less reliable products 
* supply chain attack present a risk that can be challenging to address 
* it may nearly impossbile to discover an extra chip placed on a device mainboard or change in firmware.
* ongoing security monitoring managment and assessement maybe be required, this maybe made by the end-of-chain organization or external auditor 
* if org is unable to manage thier own operation on as secure basis, how can they protect you ? 
* software, hardware myst meet ot exceed in the final product
